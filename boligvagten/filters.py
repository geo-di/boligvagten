"""Config-driven listing filters, applied after parsing — same rules for every source.

Two layers, both optional:
  * the global FILTERS dict in config.py (applies to everything, except
    sources whose SOURCES entry sets "use_global_filters": False)
  * a per-source "filters" dict inside a SOURCES entry (applies on top)

Supported keys:
  max_price_dkk / min_price_dkk       price bounds (monthly rent, or cash
                                      price for for-sale sources)
  min_rooms / max_rooms               room count bounds
  min_size_m2 / max_size_m2           size bounds
  min_monthly_fee_dkk /               ejerudgift bounds — for-sale listings
  max_monthly_fee_dkk                 only (rentals have no monthly fee)
  exclude_keywords                    drop when any appears in name/address/
                                      description (case-insensitive)
  include_keywords                    keep only when at least one appears in
                                      name/address/description — e.g. ["altan"]
  description_keywords                like include_keywords but matched against
                                      the full listing description; handled
                                      separately (see deep_apply) because it
                                      may cost one HTTP fetch per listing

A listing with an unknown (None) value always passes the numeric bounds:
better one alert too many than a silently missed apartment.
