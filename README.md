# boligvagten 🏠

**Get to Danish housing listings first — rentals *and* for-sale.** Boligvagten
stands watch over Danish housing sites around the clock and pushes an alert to
your phone the minute something new appears — because in Copenhagen, the
difference between getting a viewing and getting nothing is usually measured
in minutes.

*…and the same message lands on your phone as a push notification.*

## Why this exists

- **The portals aren't enough.** Everyone watches boligportal.dk. The private
  administrators (CEJ, Kereby, City Apartment, …) list great apartments on
  their own sites where far fewer people are looking — boligvagten watches
  both worlds at once.
- **Buying? Same game.** New for-sale listings (via Boligsiden) reach your
  phone minutes after they go live, not in tomorrow's saved-search email.
- **Speed wins.** Popular listings collect hundreds of inquiries within hours.
  An instant push notification (and optionally an auto-filled contact form,
  see below) puts you at the front of the queue.
- **Zero setup friction.** Pure Python standard library — no accounts, no API
  keys, no database, no dependencies. One command, subscribe to your alert
  channel, done.
- **Built to be forked.** Sources are plug-in modules, filters and cities are
  config, and the parsers are covered by offline tests. Making it watch *your*
  city or *your* favourite site is a small, documented change.

## Quick start

### No terminal: download and double-click

1. Download `boligvagten-<version>.zip` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/arminpasalic/boligvagten/releases/latest)
   and unzip it.
2. Double-click **Start Boligvagten** (`.command` on macOS, `.bat` on Windows).
3. Boligvagten opens in your browser. Set your searches, filters and phone
   alerts there, then press Save.

Keep the tab open while you want alerts. Closing it stops Boligvagten; your
settings and the record of listings you have already seen are kept in
`~/.config/boligvagten/` for next time.

Nothing is installed. The launcher uses the Python already on your computer
(3.9 or newer). If there is none, it downloads a temporary copy of
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Python into a temp folder and deletes it
again when Boligvagten stops.

The first time, your computer may not want to open a downloaded script:

- **macOS** says it "could not verify" the file. Click Done, open System
  Settings → Privacy & Security, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway** next
  to "Start Boligvagten.command".
- **Windows** shows "Windows protected your PC". Click **More info**, then
  **Run anyway**.

> **Chrome users:** Memory Saver may put a background tab to sleep after a
> while, which stops Boligvagten. Add `127.0.0.1` under Settings →
> Performance → "Always keep these sites active".

### From the terminal

Run the latest version directly from GitHub with `uvx`:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/arminpasalic/boligvagten.git boligvagten
```

Or install it as a persistent command:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/arminpasalic/boligvagten.git
boligvagten
```

To upgrade the installed tool later:

```bash
uv tool install --force git+https://github.com/arminpasalic/boligvagten.git
```

To uninstall it:

```bash
uv tool uninstall boligvagten
```

Or clone and run it directly — the monitor uses only the Python standard library:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arminpasalic/boligvagten.git
cd boligvagten
python3 monitor.py
```

The first run creates your personal `config.py` (in the checkout, or in
`~/.config/boligvagten/` when installed), generates a private notification
channel, and prints exactly what to do:

```
================================================================
  Get alerts on your phone (takes ~2 minutes)
================================================================
  Your private alert channel:

      https://ntfy.sh/boligvagten-fznm8pj759

  1. Install the free ntfy app:
       iPhone:  https://apps.apple.com/app/ntfy/id1625396347
       Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy
  2. In the app: tap + and subscribe to the topic:

      boligvagten-fznm8pj759

  3. A test notification was just sent — it appears once you subscribe.
================================================================
```

Install the [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) app, subscribe to your topic, and leave
the monitor running. That's the whole setup.

## Everyday commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `boligvagten` | Watch continuously, alert on new listings |
| `boligvagten --web` | Open the settings and status page in your browser (closing it stops) |
| `boligvagten --list` | One-shot search: print everything matching your filters right now |
| `boligvagten --once` | Run a single check and exit (handy for cron) |
| `boligvagten --test-notify` | Send a test push to every channel |
| `boligvagten --setup` | Re-print the phone setup instructions |
| `boligvagten --contact-test URL` | Fill in the contact form on one CEJ or Kereby listing without sending it |

Running from a clone? `python3 monitor.py` takes the same flags.

The browser page keeps its own `settings.json` in `~/.config/boligvagten/`.
On first start it copies your existing `config.py` if there is one, so both
ways of running share the same searches to begin with; after that, edit
each in its own place.

## Configuration

Everything lives in `config.py` — a heavily commented Python file created from
[config.example.py](config.example.py) on first run. It is gitignored: your
topic, your searches, and (if you enable auto-contact) your personal details
never leave your machine.

**Filters** apply to every source, with optional per-source overrides:

```python
FILTERS = {
    "max_price_dkk": 14000,
    "min_rooms": 2,
    "min_size_m2": 50,
    "exclude_keywords": ["studiebolig", "delevenlig"],
    "description_keywords": ["altan"],   # must appear in the full description
}
```

All keys are optional; besides the above there are `min_price_dkk`,
`max_rooms`, `max_size_m2`, `include_keywords`, and ejerudgift bounds
(`min`/`max_monthly_fee_dkk`) for the for-sale market. Unknown values always
pass — better one alert too many than a silently missed home.

**Another city?** The search URL *is* the search — city, price, size are all
encoded in it. Open the site, set your filters, copy the URL into the source's
config entry. Each entry in [config.example.py](config.example.py) documents
the site-specific trick (Boligportal: just use your city's page, e.g.
`/lejeboliger/aarhus/`; CEJ: append one query param; Boligsiden: edit the
documented API params; …).

**Several searches at once?** Give a source a list:

```python
"boligportal": {
    "enabled": True,
    "urls": [
        "https://www.boligportal.dk/lejeboliger/k%C3%B8benhavn/",
        "https://www.boligportal.dk/lejeboliger/aarhus/",
    ],
},
```

**Polling pace**: intervals are randomized (default 30–60 s). Be polite —
polling more frequently than the default helps little and risks getting the
affected site's attention.

Want another site? That's the fun part — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): copy
[the template](boligvagten/sources/_template.py), write one `parse()`
function, register it, done. PRs welcome — or open a
[site request](https://github.com/arminpasalic/boligvagten/issues/new?template=site_request.yml).

## Auto-contact (CEJ, Kereby) — optional

Popular listings receive a flood of inquiries almost immediately. Boligvagten
can fill out the landlord's contact form the moment a listing appears:

- **CEJ** — the 3-step form: your details, your message, your profile.
- **Kereby** — the "Interesseret?" form: name, email, message.

Each site has three settings: **Off**, **Test only** (fill the form and save a
screenshot, send nothing) and **Send**. In the browser page they're under
Auto-contact, with a **Try it now** button that fills the form on a current
listing and shows you the screenshot. In `config.py` they're the `CONTACT`
block (`auto_contact` / `live_send` per site). Everything is **off by
default**, and Send is refused while your details still contain the template's
placeholders.

From the terminal, check one listing first — this never sends:

```bash
boligvagten --contact-test "https://udlejning.cej.dk/boliger/<id>"
boligvagten --contact-test "https://kereby.dk/bolig/<address>/"
```

It drives a headless browser (Playwright). If your Python has none, a
temporary copy (about 150 MB) is downloaded when auto-contact is on and
deleted again when Boligvagten stops. What happens to each listing is
recorded in `seen_listings.json` (and listed on the page): a form that
couldn't be filled is retried up to three times; once Send has been pressed,
nothing is ever retried automatically — if the site's reply is unclear, the
entry says "needs review" so you can check by hand. During test runs every
request that could submit the form is blocked.

After a site redesign, `python scripts/check_contact.py` runs the forms on
live listings with the site's reply faked, so nothing is sent, and tells you
which step broke.

**Use it responsibly.** This submits a real housing application in your name.
Write an honest message, keep it personal, and don't spray inquiries at
apartments you wouldn't actually take — that ruins it for everyone,
including you.

## How it works

No framework, five small modules:

```
boligvagten/monitor.py     the loop: poll → diff against seen_listings.json → alert
boligvagten/sources/       one module per site; each exposes parse() + fetch()
boligvagten/filters.py     config-driven price/rooms/size/keyword filtering
boligvagten/notify.py      ntfy push + macOS banner + first-run onboarding
boligvagten/web.py         local browser UI (--web): settings, status, live log
boligvagten/contact*.py    optional auto-contact (Playwright form-filler per site)
```

New listings are detected by ID, state is written atomically, failed phone
notifications retry, and CEJ actions use a durable outbox that avoids blind
resubmission after an interrupted run. Network failures back off exponentially,
parser responses are health-checked, and every parser is tested offline against
recorded fixtures (`tests/`).

## Roadmap — sites that deserve a module

findbolig.nu · heimstaden.dk · deas.dk · home.dk lejeboliger ·
danskeboligejendomme.dk · lejebolig.dk — or whatever your city hides.
Each one is a ~40-line PR; the template walks you through it.

## Related projects

- [bolig-ping](https://github.com/saattrupdan/bolig_ping) — for-sale search on
  Boligsiden as a one-shot CLI with email digests; run it from cron if email
  suits you better than push. Boligvagten's Boligsiden support was inspired
  by it.

## Disclaimer

Boligvagten polls publicly available listing pages on your behalf, at a
human-ish pace, for personal use. Respect the sites: keep polling intervals
reasonable, don't run multiple aggressive instances, and check the terms of
service of the sites you enable. This project is not affiliated with any of
the listed sites.
